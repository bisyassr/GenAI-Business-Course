    <!-- Chosen Palette: Strategic Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a single-page, tab-based interactive dashboard. This structure replaces the linear, text-heavy format of the source report with an exploratory experience. The three main tabs correspond to the course's three series: "Discover," "Plan," and "Execute." This allows busy leaders (the target audience) to immediately navigate to the section most relevant to their needs, such as risk assessment or implementation strategy. Within each tab, content is broken down into interactive modules like clickable cards, dynamic charts, and interactive diagrams. This non-linear, task-oriented design enhances usability by prioritizing engagement, quick information retrieval, and self-assessment over passive reading, making the complex subject matter more accessible and digestible. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: 'Table 1: Generative AI Capabilities' -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Interactive Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Buttons filter the chart by value proposition (e.g., Efficiency, Innovation), dynamically updating the data. -> Justification: Transforms a static table into a dynamic tool for comparing how different GenAI capabilities contribute to specific business values, making the data more engaging.
        - Report Info: 'Table 4: Readiness Assessment Checklist' -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Viz: Interactive Checklist (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Users can check items, and a progress bar dynamically updates. -> Justification: Turns a passive checklist into a self-assessment tool, providing immediate visual feedback on organizational readiness.
        - Report Info: 'Table 3: Risks and Mitigation' -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Viz: Interactive Grid (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Clicking a risk category card reveals its detailed description and mitigation strategy. -> Justification: Breaks down dense information into manageable, clickable chunks, improving readability and focus.
        - Report Info: 'Table 5: Adoption Maturity Model' -> Goal: Organize/Change -> Viz: Interactive Process Diagram (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Clicking on a stage in the visual timeline displays detailed information about that stage. -> Justification: Represents a process more intuitively than a table, helping users understand the sequential nature of AI adoption.
